# The Idea Wizard

Generate improvement ideas, then ruthlessly filter to the best ones.

## The Prompt

```
Come up with your very best ideas for improving this project to make it more robust, reliable, performant, intuitive, user-friendly, ergonomic, useful, compelling, etc. while still being obviously accretive and pragmatic.

Come up with 30 ideas and then really think through each idea carefully, how it would work, how users are likely to perceive it, how we would implement it, etc; then winnow that list down to your VERY best 5 ideas.

Explain each of the 5 ideas in order from best to worst and give your full, detailed rationale and justification for how and why it would make the project obviously better and why you're confident of that assessment.

Use ultrathink.
```

## Why It Works

**Scope expansion then contraction:** Forces divergent thinking (30 ideas) before convergent filtering (5 best). This prevents premature narrowing.

**Self-verification built in:** "Really think through each idea carefully" triggers metacognition before the final list.

**Multi-criteria evaluation:** Robust, reliable, performant, intuitive, user-friendly, ergonomic, useful, compelling — covers all angles.

**Pragmatism anchor:** "Obviously accretive and pragmatic" prevents pie-in-the-sky ideas that would never get implemented.

**Intensity calibration:** `ultrathink` allocates maximum reasoning depth.

## Patterns Used

- Intensity Calibration (`ultrathink`)
- Scope Control (30 ideas → 5)
- Self-Verification (think through each carefully)
- First Principles (rationale and justification)
